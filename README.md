# GyojiBot

Discord bot to automate slohyo submissions for the Road-To-Yokozuna discord game => https://discord.gg/cTUdpc9

This bot will likely be extended in the future to be able to run matches, but this is beyond the current scope of the project.

Ensure you have [python3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-381/) installed with `pip`

1. `sudo -H pip install -U pipenv`
